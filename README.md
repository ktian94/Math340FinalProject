# Math340FinalProject
Final project data analysis for Applied Statistical Methods II. We'll explore public data provided by the World Bank database to see how health outcomes relate to education and economic factors for young women.

Project Proposal Summary
Overall, the scientific question that we are trying to answer is how education rates, fertility rates, and socioeconomic factors 
interact with one another.  The datasets we chose are count observations for countries around the world.  We will observe the 
data more closely to determine which dataset is the best candidate for a response variable.  We will see how factors such as 
literacy rate in females, adolescent fertility rate, and GDP of the countries are correlated to one another using various 
statistical methods. The statistical models that we will use are regression models to look at the strength of correlation, and 
classification models to examine the percentage threshold that differentiates countries with high versus low youth well-being.

List of Questions to Investigate:
How do early fertility rates correlate with health factors, education factors, and employment factors for females?
Can we classify a country with “good” or “bad” fertility rates based off the health, education, and employment factors?
Can we classify a country on the uptrend or downtrend based off nonobvious variables?
